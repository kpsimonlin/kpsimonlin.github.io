I am a PhD student studying evolutionary biology. My major interests are centered around how different evolutionary forces may shape the architechture of populations and species on a molecular level.

I use a combination of bioinformatic analyses, computer simulations, and experiments to explore various subjects. Right now I am focusing on the speciation genomics of three-spined sticklebacks and the conservation genetics of Formosan fruit bat.
