I am a PhD student studying evolutionary biology. My major interest is centered around how various evolutionary forces shape the architechture of populations and species on their molecular level.

I use a combination of bioinformatic analyses, computer simulations, and experiments to explore various fields, including but not restricted to speciation, population genetics, and conservation genomics.
