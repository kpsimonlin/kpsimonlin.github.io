I am a PhD student studying evolutionary biology. My major interests are centered around how various evolutionary forces shape the architechture of populations and species on molecular level.

I use a combination of bioinformatic analyses, computer simulations, and experiments to explore many facinating topics. Right now I am focusing on the speciation genomics of three-spined sticklebacks and the conservation genetics of Formosan flying fox.
