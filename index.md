I am a PhD student studying evolutionary biology. My major research interests include speciation, population genetics, and conservation genomics. I use a combination of bioinformatic analyses, computer simulations, and experiments to explore these fascinating topics. The center of my research interests is how various evolutionary can shape the architechture of indiviudual, populations, and species, specifically on their molecular level.
