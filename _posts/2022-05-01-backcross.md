Postzygotic reproductive barriers are often thought to be in the form of gene-gene incompatibility and therefore play a reduced role in early speciation. However, postzygotic isolation can also appear via [phenotypic incompatibility](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001469). This type of extrinsic (environment-depentdent) reproductive isolation can emerge fast in incipient species pairs and promote rapid speciation, but is hard to detect when measured in lab. Therefore, I set up backcross populations from benthic and limnetic stickleback species pair and conduct experiments in semi-natural ponds. Using molecular markers, the trajectories of the minor parent component in each backcross population can be resolved. The selection driving the trajectory then will be uncovered using a combination of population genetic analyses and compuer simulations.
