Formosan flying fox (*Pteropus dasymallus formosus*) is a critically endangered fruit bat subspecies in Taiwan. However, its demographic history and relationship with the nearby fruit bat subspecies were largely unknown. This critical information can be important for guiding future conservation policies. Using genomic sequences from Formosan flying foxes and some neighboring subspecies, I resolved the population changes and history shared among them. My findings suggest that the Formosan flying fox should be considered as an independent conservation unit with urgent protection. Other relevant results can be found in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esab007). This project is still ongoing with more subspecies being included.
