Formosan flying fox (*Pteropus dasymallus formosus*) is an critically endangered fruit bat subspecies in Taiwan. However, its demographic history and relationship with the nearby fruit bat subspecies were largely unknown. Using genomic sequences from Formosan flying foxes and some neighboring subspecies, I resolved the population changes and history shared among them. Relevant results can be found in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esab007). This valuable information will serve as guideline for future conservation policies. This project is still ongoing with more subspecies being included.
