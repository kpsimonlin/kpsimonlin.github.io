How to choose the key parameters during sequence assembly for Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing (RADSeq) has been known to be important. Using parameters not suitable for a particular dataset could cause significant bias in downstream analyses, resulting in false conclusion. The conventional ways for solving this issue are usually centered around picking a set of parameter that optimizes certain metrics defined during the bioinformatic process (e.g., [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12775)). Here I work on a new method for determining the optimal parameters through a likelihood estimator based on the nucleotide diversity in the given dataset. Part of the result can be found in my [published paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esab007). You can try out a [Python script](https://github.com/kpsimonlin/lepra) I wrote for this method.
