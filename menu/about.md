I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Schluter lab](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/) at the University of British Columbia.

I grew up in South Taiwan, where the blooming biodiversity inspired me to dream of becoming a biologist. My enthusiasm for evolutionary study then started to sprout soon after learning about Darwin's theory and Dawkins' gene-centered view of evolution. 

I finished my bachelor and master in [Dr. Wen-Ya Ko's lab](https://dls.nycu.edu.tw/faculty/faculty-member/wenko.html) at National Yang-Ming University in Taiwan, where I studied the conservation genetics of an endangered bat species. Through this study, I was intrigued by how incipient species could develope into mature and isolated species. Therefore, I decided to take a detour to speciation problems for my doctoral research. I am now working on the speciation genomics of three-spined stickleback in British Columbia, Canada.

Outside of my academic career, I am also a keen outdoorsman who enjoys backcountry, rock climbing, and recently skiing. Check the [Gallery](https://kpsimonlin.github.io/gallery.html) for photos from some of my favorite trips.

## About my name

Kung-Ping is from the old Wade–Giles romanization system and actually sounds more like "Gong-Ping," here is what it is like in traditional Chinese characters: 林恭平.

I am also happy to be called KP for short.
