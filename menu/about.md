I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Schluter lab](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/) at the University of British Columbia.

I grew up in South Taiwan, where the blooming biodiversity inspired me to dream of becoming a biologist. My enthusiasm for evolutionary study then started to sprout soon after learning about Darwin's theory and Dawkins' gene-centered view of evolution. 

I finished my bachelor and master in [Dr. Wen-Ya Ko's lab](https://dls.nycu.edu.tw/faculty/faculty-member/wenko.html) at National Yang-Ming University in Taiwan, where I studied the conservation genetics of an endangered bat species. During that time, I was intrigued by how incipient species (which are defined as "evolutionarily significant units" in conservation biology) could develope into mature and isolated species. Thus, I decided to take a detour to speciation problems for my doctoral research. I am now focusing on the speciation genomics of three-spined stickleback in British Columbia, Canada.

Apart from my academic interests, I am also a keen outdoorsman who enjoy backcountry, rock climbing, and recently skiing. Make sure to check my Gallery for some of the exciting trips I have done.

# About my name

Kung-Ping is from the old Wade–Giles romanization system and actually sounds more like "Gong-Ping," here is what it is like in traditional Chinese characters: 林恭平.

I am also happy to be called KP for short.
