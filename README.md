Please enter my personal website [here](https://kpsimonlin.github.io/).

This website was developed based on *Lagrange*, a freely distributed Jekyll theme. If you like this style, make sure to visit its [Github page](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) and [demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/).

Some useful tips for managing the site (for me):
- Home page is defined in /index.md
- Add research interest post in /\_post folder
- Add image in /assets/img folder
- Tags are defined in /\_data/settings.yml
- The content of tags besides "Research" can be accessed in /menu folder
- The content of "Research" tag is in /research folder
- Icons should be managed by modifying /\_sass/\_social-icons.scss, /assets/css/main.scss, and /\_includes/social-icons.html
- favicon can be changed by uploading new /favicon.ico
- 404 page is defined by /404.md
- Images for the Gallery is in /\assets/\img/\album/
